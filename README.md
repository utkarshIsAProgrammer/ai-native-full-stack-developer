# 🧑🏾‍💻 AI Native Full Stack Developer — Roadmap Archive

This repository contains my **entire journey** from absolute beginner to AI-native full-stack developer, structured according to the [Re-Awakened Roadmap](#). It's my local archive of all the phases, projects, experiments, and dev rituals.

⚠️ This repo is for **personal progress tracking and practice code only**.  
Only **production-grade, deployed projects** are published as individual GitHub repositories.
