🗓️ Day 1 – JavaScript Foundations: Variables, Data Types, Type Coercion (07-August-2025)

✅ What I Worked On:

- Reviewed primitive data types: string, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol, bigint
- Practiced variable declarations using var, let, and const
- Explored type coercion and conversion
- Wrote small JS snippets to test truthy/falsy values and coercion

🧠 Key Learnings:

- let and const have block scope, var does not
- JavaScript is loosely typed — type coercion happens implicitly
- == allows coercion, === does not (strict comparison)
- Use typeof to inspect variable types

🚧 Blockers:

- Confused when null showed up as 'object' in typeof

💡 Fixes:

- Referred to MDN Type Coercion Docs
