🗓️ Day 3 – Functions, Parameters, Return Values (09-August-2025)

✅ What I Worked On:

- Created basic JavaScript functions using function declaration and arrow syntax
- Learned to pass parameters and return values
- Built small utilities (greet user, add numbers, calculate BMI)
- Refactored CLI menu app to use functions for modularity

🧠 Key Learnings:

- Functions improve code reuse and readability
- Arrow functions are concise but differ with this context
- return immediately exits the function and sends back a value
- Naming functions based on action (e.g., handleInput(), logOut()) improves clarity

📌 Next Up:

- Scope, Hoisting, Closures (Day 4)
