🗓️ Day 2 – Control Flow (if/else, switch, loops) (08-August-2025)

✅ What I Worked On:

- Wrote if, else if, and else conditional statements
- Explored switch statements with multiple cases
- Practiced loops: for, while, do...while
- Built small condition-checking snippets in JS (grade checker, age group labeler, even odd sum)

🧠 Key Learnings:

- Always include a default case in switch
- Loop control: break exits loop early, continue skips current iteration
- while checks condition first, do...while runs at least once
- Conditionals combined with logical operators (&&, ||, !) make code powerful

📌 Next Up:

- Functions, parameters, return values (Day 3)
