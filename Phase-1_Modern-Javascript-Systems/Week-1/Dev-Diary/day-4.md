🗓️ Day 4 – JavaScript Scopes, Closures, Hoisting (10-August-2025)

✅ What I Worked On:

- Studied different types of scopes in JavaScript: global, function, and block
- Practiced writing functions to understand closures
- Explored the concept of lexical scope and how variables are resolved
- Played with examples of hoisting in both var, let, and const
- Debugged variable visibility issues using Chrome DevTools

🧠 Key Learnings:

- Functions "remember" their lexical environment — that’s what closures are
- let and const are block-scoped and not hoisted the same way as var
- Function declarations are hoisted fully, but function expressions are not
- Accessing let/const before declaration results in a ReferenceError (temporal dead zone)
