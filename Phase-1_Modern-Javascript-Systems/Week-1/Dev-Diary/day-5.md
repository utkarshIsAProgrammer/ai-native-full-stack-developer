🗓️ Day 5 – JavaScript Callbacks & Event Listeners (11-August-2025)

✅ What I Worked On:

- Understood the concept of callbacks and why they’re used in asynchronous operations
- Wrote functions that accept other functions as arguments
- Practiced using anonymous functions and arrow functions as callbacks
- Learned how to attach event listeners using addEventListener()
- Created interactive examples with click, mouseover, and keydown events

🧠 Key Learnings:

- A callback function is passed into another function to be executed later
- Callbacks are essential in handling asynchronous tasks like API calls or user actions
- addEventListener() allows multiple listeners for the same event, unlike inline onclick
- Event objects (event) provide useful info such as target element and event type
- Removing listeners with removeEventListener() requires referencing the exact same function

📌 Next Up:

- Explore DOM manipulation with events and start chaining event-driven functions
