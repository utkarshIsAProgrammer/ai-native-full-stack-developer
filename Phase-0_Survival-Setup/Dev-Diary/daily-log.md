### 🗓️ Day 1 – Git, GitHub & Markdown (05-August-2025)

✅ What I Worked On:

-   Installed Git + setup global configs
-   Created GitHub account and test repo
-   Practiced `init`, `add`, `commit`, `push`, `clone`
-   Created a GitHub Profile README and pushed it

🧠 Key Learnings:

-   Understood how Git tracks file history
-   Markdown is simple but powerful (headings, lists, code blocks)
-   The concept of Conventional Commits makes history cleaner

🚧 Blockers:

-   Took some time to understand how to make conventional commits
-   Spend too much in pushing code to github using git in vscode

💡 Fixes:

-   Visited [NPM Git Conventional Commits](https://www.npmjs.com/package/git-conventional-commits)
-   Visited [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46877667/how-to-add-a-new-project-to-github-using-vs-code)

📌 Next Up:

-   Setup Dev Diary folder + VSCode DevTools (Day 2 + 3)

===============================================================================================================

### 🗓️ Day 2 – Dev Diary Setup (05-August-2025)

✅ What I Worked On:

-   Created `Dev-Diary` folder in my roadmap repo
-   Added `daily-log.md` and logged Day 1 progress
-   Structured the diary system for daily + weekly tracking
-   Learned the difference between journaling vs developer logging

🧠 Key Learnings:

-   Dev Diaries are meant for **progress tracking**, not just thoughts
-   Small logs compound into **valuable retros** over time
-   Markdown files can be versioned and reused like code

🚧 Blockers:

-   Unsure about how much detail to write
-   Overthought file/folder structure at first

💡 Fixes:

-   Used a consistent template to stay focused
-   Reminded myself: "Done > Perfect" for logging

📌 Next Up:

-   Set up VSCode environment and extensions (Day 3)
-   Start customizing my `.vscode/settings.json` and workspace setup

===============================================================================================================

### 🗓️ Day 3 – VSCode Setup (05-August-2025)

✅ What I Worked On:

-   Installed **VSCode** as my primary IDE for full-stack dev
-   Installed core extensions: Prettier, ESLint, GitLens, Path Intellisense, Code Spell Checker
-   Customized VSCode UI: theme, font, keybindings
-   Changed `.vscode/settings.json` for consistent formatting rules in vscode
-   Practiced formatting on save and resolving ESLint warnings

🧠 Key Learnings:

-   Prettier ensures consistent style automatically
-   ESLint catches potential bugs before runtime
-   GitLens helps me track commit authors, history, and diffs fast
-   `.vscode/settings.json` keeps team config shared and consistent

🚧 Blockers:

-   Minor conflicts between Prettier and ESLint rules

💡 Fixes:

-   Tweaked settings to avoid conflicts (e.g., autoFixOnSave)

📌 Next Up:

-   Practice Chrome DevTools for debugging (Day 4)
-   Explore Elements, Console, Sources, Network panels

===============================================================================================================

### 🗓️ Day 4 – Chrome DevTools & Debugger (07-August-2025)

✅ What I Worked On:

-   Explored Chrome DevTools panels: Elements, Console, Network, and Sources
-   Practiced inspecting HTML structure and styles via the Elements panel
-   Used breakpoints and step-by-step debugging in the Sources tab
-   Observed API requests and responses in the Network panel using a demo site
-   Learned how to view call stacks and watch variables in real time

🧠 Key Learnings:

-   DevTools are **non-negotiable** for debugging real projects
-   The **Sources tab** is like a live JS debugger — step-through > `console.log` spam
-   Network tab shows how frontends talk to APIs — useful for async JS & fetch debugging
-   You can simulate mobile devices + throttle network speed for UX testing

🚧 Blockers:

-   Struggled to understand how breakpoints pause at the right lines
-   Spent too much time inspecting random pages instead of structured practice

💡 Fixes:

-   Re-watched a short video on JS debugging workflows
-   Took quick notes on what each panel is for — now using them intentionally

📌 Next Up:

-   Begin Day 5: Git Branching & Feature Branch Flow
-   Practice creating a local feature branch and merging via simulated PR
