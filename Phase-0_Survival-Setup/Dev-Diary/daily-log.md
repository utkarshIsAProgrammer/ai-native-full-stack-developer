### 🗓️ Day 1 – Git, GitHub & Markdown (05-August-2025)

✅ What I Worked On:

- Installed Git + setup global configs
- Created GitHub account and test repo
- Practiced `init`, `add`, `commit`, `push`, `clone`
- Created a GitHub Profile README and pushed it

🧠 Key Learnings:

- Understood how Git tracks file history
- Markdown is simple but powerful (headings, lists, code blocks)
- The concept of Conventional Commits makes history cleaner

🚧 Blockers:

- Took some time to understand how to make conventional commits
- Spend too much in pushing code to github using git in vscode

💡 Fixes:

- Visited [NPM Git Conventional Commits](https://www.npmjs.com/package/git-conventional-commits)
- Visited [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46877667/how-to-add-a-new-project-to-github-using-vs-code)

📌 Next Up:

- Setup Dev Diary folder + VSCode DevTools (Day 2 + 3)

===============================================================================================================

### 🗓️ Day 2 – Dev Diary Setup (05-August-2025)

✅ What I Worked On:

- Created `Dev-Diary` folder in my roadmap repo
- Added `daily-log.md` and logged Day 1 progress
- Structured the diary system for daily + weekly tracking
- Learned the difference between journaling vs developer logging

🧠 Key Learnings:

- Dev Diaries are meant for **progress tracking**, not just thoughts
- Small logs compound into **valuable retros** over time
- Markdown files can be versioned and reused like code

🚧 Blockers:

- Unsure about how much detail to write
- Overthought file/folder structure at first

💡 Fixes:

- Used a consistent template to stay focused
- Reminded myself: "Done > Perfect" for logging

📌 Next Up:

- Set up VSCode environment and extensions (Day 3)
- Start customizing my `.vscode/settings.json` and workspace setup

===============================================================================================================

### 🗓️ Day 3 – VSCode Setup (05-August-2025)

✅ What I Worked On:

- Installed **VSCode** as my primary IDE for full-stack dev
- Installed core extensions: Prettier, ESLint, GitLens, Path Intellisense, Code Spell Checker
- Customized VSCode UI: theme, font, keybindings
- Changed `.vscode/settings.json` for consistent formatting rules in vscode
- Practiced formatting on save and resolving ESLint warnings

🧠 Key Learnings:

- Prettier ensures consistent style automatically
- ESLint catches potential bugs before runtime
- GitLens helps me track commit authors, history, and diffs fast
- `.vscode/settings.json` keeps team config shared and consistent

🚧 Blockers:

- Minor conflicts between Prettier and ESLint rules

💡 Fixes:

- Tweaked settings to avoid conflicts (e.g., autoFixOnSave)

📌 Next Up:

- Practice Chrome DevTools for debugging (Day 4)
- Explore Elements, Console, Sources, Network panels

===============================================================================================================

### 🗓️ Day 4 – Chrome DevTools & Debugger (07-August-2025)

✅ What I Worked On:

- Explored Chrome DevTools panels: Elements, Console, Network, and Sources
- Practiced inspecting HTML structure and styles via the Elements panel
- Used breakpoints and step-by-step debugging in the Sources tab
- Observed API requests and responses in the Network panel using a demo site
- Learned how to view call stacks and watch variables in real time

🧠 Key Learnings:

- DevTools are **non-negotiable** for debugging real projects
- The **Sources tab** is like a live JS debugger — step-through > `console.log` spam
- Network tab shows how frontends talk to APIs — useful for async JS & fetch debugging
- You can simulate mobile devices + throttle network speed for UX testing

🚧 Blockers:

- Struggled to understand how breakpoints pause at the right lines
- Spent too much time inspecting random pages instead of structured practice

💡 Fixes:

- Re-watched a short video on JS debugging workflows
- Took quick notes on what each panel is for — now using them intentionally

📌 Next Up:

- Begin Day 5: Git Branching & Feature Branch Flow
- Practice creating a local feature branch and merging via simulated PR

===============================================================================================================

🗓️ Day 5 – Git Branching & Feature Branch Flow (08-August-2025)

✅ What I Worked On:

- Learned git branch, checkout, merge, and rebase
- Created a local feature branch and worked on a sample file
- Simulated a Pull Request by pushing to GitHub and merging it via UI
- Practiced using git stash and resolving basic merge conflicts
- Explored .gitignore, LICENSE, and CONTRIBUTING.md basics

🧠 Key Learnings:

- Branching allows parallel dev work — must-have in team environments
- Feature branches = safe experimentation, master stays clean
- PR simulation taught me how GitHub workflows actually feel in companies
- .gitignore helps prevent accidental commits (like node_modules)

🚧 Blockers:

- Merge conflict felt confusing — wasn’t sure which changes to keep
- Struggled to remember the difference between merge and rebase

💡 Fixes:

- Solved conflict by using VSCode's built-in merge tool
- Created a visual note summarizing merge vs rebase with examples

📌 Next Up:
Setup README-first development workflow (Day 6)

===============================================================================================================================================

🗓️ Day 6 – README-First Workflow (09-August-2025)

✅ What I Worked On:

- Learned the concept of README-driven development
- Created a sample project and drafted README.md before coding
- Defined:
- Project purpose
- Tech stack
- Folder structure
- Feature list
- Pushed the repo with just the README and .gitignore initially
- Practiced writing clear commit messages with Conventional Commits

🧠 Key Learnings:

- README-first forces clarity before chaos — it’s like a product spec
- It’s easier to build when you know what you're building
- GitHub repos with good READMEs feel instantly professional
- Writing the README first keeps scope creep in check

🚧 Blockers:

- Found it hard to visualize a project structure from scratch
- Kept overthinking feature descriptions and what to include

💡 Fixes:

- Used ChatGPT to generate a rough README template
- Focused on MVP only, not edge cases or extras

📌 Next Up:

- Final Review + Dummy PR (Day 7)

===============================================================================================================================================

🗓️ Day 7 – Final Review + PR Simulation (10-August-2025)

✅ What I Worked On:

- Reviewed and cleaned up all Phase 0 work
- Finalized README.md, .gitignore, and commit history for dummy project
- Created a dummy Pull Request and merged it into the main branch
- Verified GitHub green streak and GitHub profile visuals
- Wrote short Dev Diary reflection on Week 0 learnings

🧠 Key Learnings:

- Setting up systems takes time but pays off long-term
- PR creation & merge is a powerful habit — even for solo devs
- GitHub commit streak is a great motivator (gameified discipline)
- Professional repos aren’t about complex code — they’re about clarity + structure

🚧 Blockers:

- Forgot to create the PR from a feature branch at first
- Accidentally committed directly to main once

💡 Fixes:

- Recreated the PR workflow step-by-step with notes
- Updated .git/config to set main as protected locally

📌 Next Up:

- Start Phase 1 – JavaScript Core (Week 1, Day 1)

===============================================================================================================================================
